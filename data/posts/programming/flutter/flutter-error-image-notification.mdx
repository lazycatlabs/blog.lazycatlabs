summary: 'Resolve error when add support Image Notification in iOS with Firebase Cloud Message'
---

If you use [Firebase Cloud Message](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_messaging) to send Notifications in Flutter, you need to do [an extra step](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/flutter/receive#display_images_in_notifications_on_ios) for iOS to enable Push Notification with Image.

However the documentation is not clear and complete in some steps, so in this article, we will try to resolve all errors after we follow the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/flutter/receive#display_images_in_notifications_on_ios) from Official Firebase.

Based on that documentation, in this [step](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/flutter/receive#step_3_-_use_the_extension_helper) make sure you set the `ImageNotification` module `not embedded` in your existing project because that can make fail when you want to create a release build. Don't forget to set `Minimum Deployments` as same as your existing project to make it support lower OS versions.

## GoogleUtilities Error when creating a release build

When you run your app in debug mode you will not be facing that issue.
But when you want to create a release build, you will get this error.

```
'/Users/User/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Runner-bdnpxekydrzewgcrgsvvbfowmdtn/Build/Intermediates.noindex/Arch
iveIntermediates/prd/IntermediateBuildFilesPath/UninstalledProducts/iphoneos/GoogleUtilities.framework'


Encountered error while archiving for device.

```

How to resolve that?
We need to update our `Podfile` file to be like this

```
...

target 'Runner' do
  use_frameworks!
  use_modular_headers!
  pod 'GoogleUtilities'  #add this

  flutter_install_all_ios_pods File.dirname(File.realpath(__FILE__))
end

target 'ImageNotification' do
  use_frameworks!
  pod 'GoogleUtilities'  #add this
  pod 'Firebase/Messaging'
end
```

After that, you can create a new release build 🎉
