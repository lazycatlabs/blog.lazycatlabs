## Background

I have created a web using Flutter Web, you can see on [lazycatlabs.com](https://lazycatlabs.com/) also for Video Showcase you can see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y07lDPzfVgk). So I want to try to slice the UI component from what I use on my Flutter web.

## Component

The first component I want to share is the simple one.
The mouse scroll animation. üñ±Ô∏è

</div>

Actually, you can easily to create GIF file and use that as asset, or using [Lottie](https://pub.dev/packages/lottie) to load animation. But in this case, I'm trying to create that widget manually because at the same time I want to learn something new like create animation on Flutter.

## Create the component

In the Flutter, we have a playground to do simple code in here [dartpad.dev](https://dartpad.dev/)

- Click `New Pad`
- Choose `Flutter`
- And click `Run` button to check the result should be like this.

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lazycatlabs/blog.lazycatlabs.com-giscus/main/blog-assets/IMAGE%202023-02-18%2015%3A03%3A39.jpg" />
</div>

So the first one, we need to create a new class `Animated Mouse`

```dart
class AnimatedMouse extends StatefulWidget {
  const AnimatedMouse({super.key});

  @override
  State<AnimatedMouse> createState() => _AnimatedMouseState();
}

class _AnimatedMouseState extends State<AnimatedMouse>
    with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  ...
}
```

When we are starting to create animation, we need `TickerProvider` class and that's why we add `with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin` to make our component support animation.

After that, we should create a controller to manage the animation

```dart
late final AnimationController _animationController = AnimationController(
  duration: const Duration(seconds:1)
  vsync: this,
)..repeat(reverse:true);
```

For animation duration, we set it into `1 second` and we do `repeat` the animation with `reverse:true` to make our animation looping, and also for the `vsync: this`, `this` is reference to `TickerProvider` from `SingleTickerProviderStateMixin`. And why I'm using `late` when create the variable, because when using late I don't need to initialize the data manually on `initState` method.

And the next is to create `Alignment Animation`, as you can see the mouse scroll is moving from `topCenter` to `Center`.

```dart
late final Animation<Alignment> _animatedAlign =
    Tween(begin: Alignment.topCenter, end: const Alignment(0, 0.45))
        .animate(_animationController);
```

So, we create `Animation` variable will return `Alignment` with start animation is `Aligment.topCenter` and the end of animation to `Alignment(0,0.45)` which is `Alignment.bottomCenter` is equal `Alignment(0.0,1.0)` and animate using `_animationController`.

After that, we need to build the component using `AnimatedBuilder`.

```dart

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  /// We wrap the widget with `AnimatedBuilder`
  /// and using controller from `_animationController`
  return AnimatedBuilder(
    animation: _animationController,
    builder: (context, _) {
       /// And then we using `AnimatedContainer`
       /// to move scrollbar based on `_animatedAlign.value`
      return AnimatedContainer(
        duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 300),
        width: 30,
        height: 70,
        alignment: _animatedAlign.value,
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(30),
          border: Border.all(
            color: Colors.white,
            width: 3,
          ),
        ),
        /// We also using `AnimatedOpacity`
        /// to show/hide the mouse scrollbar based on AnimationStatus
        child: AnimatedOpacity(
          duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 300),
          opacity:
              _animationController.status == AnimationStatus.forward ? 1 : 0,
          child: Container(
            width: 4,
            height: 12,
            decoration: BoxDecoration(
              color: Colors.white,
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      );
    },
  );
}
```

Here for the result:

## Full Code

Here for the full code

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class AnimatedMouse extends StatefulWidget {
  const AnimatedMouse({super.key});

  @override
  State<AnimatedMouse> createState() => _AnimatedMouseState();
}

class _AnimatedMouseState extends State<AnimatedMouse>
    with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  late final AnimationController _animationController = AnimationController(
    duration: const Duration(seconds: 1),
    vsync: this,
  )..repeat(reverse: true);

  late final Animation<Alignment> _animatedAlign =
      Tween(begin: Alignment.topCenter, end: const Alignment(0, 0.45))
          .animate(_animationController);

  @override
  void dispose() {
    /// Dispose animationController
	  _animationController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
 Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  /// We wrap the widget with `AnimatedBuilder`
  /// and using controller from `_animationController`
	  return AnimatedBuilder(
	    animation: _animationController,
	    builder: (context, _) {
	       /// And then we using `AnimatedContainer`
	       /// to move scrollbar based on `_animatedAlign.value`
	      return AnimatedContainer(
	        duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 300),
	        width: 30,
	        height: 50,
	        alignment: _animatedAlign.value,
	        decoration: BoxDecoration(
	          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(30),
	          border: Border.all(
	            color: Colors.white,
	            width: 3,
	          ),
	        ),
	        /// We also using `AnimatedOpacity`
	        /// to show/hide the mouse scrollbar based on AnimationStatus
	        child: AnimatedOpacity(
	          duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 300),
	          opacity:
	              _animationController.status == AnimationStatus.forward ? 1 : 0,
	          child: Container(
	            width: 4,
	            height: 12,
	            decoration: BoxDecoration(
	              color: Colors.white,
	              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
	            ),
	          ),
	        ),
	      );
	    },
	  );
  }
}
